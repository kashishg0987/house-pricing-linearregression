# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

#Overview
This project predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model. It follows the complete
machine learning workflow from data collection to model evaluation and visualization.

#Dataset
- Housing.csv
- Contains numerical features related to house pricing

# Steps Performed
1. Data collection and loading
2. Data exploration and cleaning
3. Feature selection (numerical features)
4. Train-test split
5. Linear Regression model training
6. Model evaluation using MSE and R² score
7. Visualization of actual vs predicted values

#Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

# How to Run
1. Place Housing.csv in the same folder as the notebook
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run all cells

# Output
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²) score
- Actual vs Predicted graph
